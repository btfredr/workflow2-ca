Workflow 2 Course Assignment Fredrik Fordelsen

Assignment: 

The aim of this assignment was to convert an old project from JavaScript to TypeScript, as well as testing functions.

Tech/Frameworks used (see package.json): 
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - TypeScript
    - JavaScript
    - Parcel
    - Jest
    - Babel

Project information: 

The site itself is an exam assignment from my first year of Front-End Development. All of the content displayed is from SpaceX or things associated with it. Code wise, the site uses things like for example basic fetch code to display how many people are currently in space etc.

Other content and images are taken from SpaceX.

Installation: 

The site can be ran either by using parcel or VS Code's live server feature. If you want to test the functions you can enter 'yarn run test' in the terminal.
